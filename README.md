## 📊 Project Overview

This project analyzes Formula 1 telemetry data from race sessions to extract meaningful driver behavior patterns. Using advanced feature engineering and clustering algorithms (KMeans, Agglomerative, DBSCAN), it identifies distinct driving styles based on throttle, braking, speed, and RPM data. 

An interactive [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io) dashboard allows dynamic exploration of driver clusters and telemetry distributions. SHAP explanations enhance interpretability by showing which features influence cluster assignment, offering insights for teams, analysts, and fans.
